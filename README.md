Made using Unity 2022.1.8f1 and C#.

This project was worked on for 1 week where I made a remake of the classic M*A*S*H game for the Atari 2600. This was for my Games Studio 1 subject for my university.
It simply included a randomly generated set of soldiers and trees on the screen which the player (helicopter) has to collect the soldiers and send them to the nearby hospital without crashing in a tree.

This project was invididual work.
